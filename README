Timeline Widget filter
======================

A Moodle filter to embed an MIT SIMILE Timeline Javascript widget.

Requirements: tested with Moodle 1.9.7 (all Moodle 1.9.x should work).

Uses: MIT SIMILE; also, parse_ini_string function (compat.php).

Installation
------------ 
1. Download and unzip the code files. Copy to the directory on the server,
     eg. /var/www/moodle/filter/timelinewidget/
2. Log in to Moodle as admin, visit Site Administration | Modules | Filters | Manage Filters. Scroll down and click on the icon for Timelinewidget to enable it.

Usage
-----
Type the following in Moodle's rich-editor (note, line-breaks, which can
be represented by <br /> are required):

[Timeline]
; A comment.
title  = Important inventions timeline
dataUrl= /moodle/file.php/2/simile-invent.xml
; The date on which to centre the timeline initially. This can
; be just a year, or a full date, eg. 20 January 1870.
date   = 1870
; UPPER-CASE! minute,hour,day,week,month,year,decade,century,millenium.
intervalUnit  = CENTURY
; How wide should the unit defined above be? In pixels.
intervalPixels= 75
[/Timeline]


NOTE. The filter creates a very simple timeline, with only one band!
